# language-rebol package

Syntax highlighting and snippets for the REBOL, Red and Red/System programming languages.

This package was automatically generated using Atom based on the Rebol TextMate plugin created by Christopher Ross-Gill, which is available on [Github](https://github.com/rgchris/rebol-tmbundle), so 99.9% of the credit belongs to him and if there are bugs you can likely credit them to me doing something horribly and unforgivably wrong, or if I'm lucky the Atom TextMate converter going bonkers.

Like the original TextMate plugin, this Atom plugin is licensed under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md).
